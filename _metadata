  "description" : "Makes all doors open and close automatically! \n\nLast update: v3.5 -big code rewrite by bk3k, check the changelogs for details\n\nYou come home from a hard and hefty farming day, and then there is it. The door. Doesn't it bother you to ever press that E button open it? Fear no more, citizen, for convenience is here! \n\nThis mod makes all doors in the game (all that rely onto doors.lua actually) automatic. This means you'll be able to just walk straight forward against a door and it will open and close without your consent! \nThough you should probably be careful when there are monsters at your door, as you will open the door now when you come too close... \nIt also open automatically ONLY for players, NPCs still have to use doors manually and monsters still can't open them. \nThough NPCs also close the doors automatically behind them now, which means that you no longer have to worry that monsters might slip into your house! (Though it is not 100% foolproof if a monster stands right next to the door when the NPC opens it) \nDoors should also behave as normal doors when they are locked or wired, wiring a door disables automatic mode while dewiring one enables it again. \nIf a door behaves funky after you downloaded a new version, walk through it and away from it once and see that the NPCs do the same, also be sure to reload your game!\n\nIn case of issues: If you are getting stuck, like in a mission, you can open the chat and type \"/admin\" followed by \"/settileprotection 0 false\". This allows you to destroy blocks. Set it to true again after you got through the faulty door so you don't lose the experience. And report the issue to me :)\n\n\nAlso if you recognize any bugs, or have any wishes or future ideas, please feel free to report them to me (us rather), I will try to fix them then.\n\nDiscuss the mod here: http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/automatic-doors.74792/\n\nCredit: bigthanks to healthire for some minor help and especially to bk3k for updating it to 1.0 and greatly updating the code!\n\nMy other mods: \nGive me Cotton! - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732096973 \nNPC Killer - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761746889",
